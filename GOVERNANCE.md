## Decision-Making

### Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus)

RESTEasy primarily aims for a consensus-based decision-making process, where Maintainers and active Contributors discuss
and come to an agreement.

In practice, this involves:

* Discussing matters openly, to facilitate others joining the discussions and expressing concerns.
* Taking into account every Contributor’s opinion, regardless of their role.

> [!NOTE]
> Actual implementation of consensus decision-making is up to Maintainers and can vary based on the audience and
> criticality of the discussion. Inspiration may be found in
> the [Lazy Consensus model as defined by the Apache Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html),
> and in [Martha’s Rules](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=sociologyfacpub).

## Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise, Maintainers are responsible for facilitating a resolution.

1. The **Project Lead** or **Organization Project Lead** holds the power to make the final decision.
2. As a last resort, in particular in case of disagreement about the decision-making process, the **Commonhaus
   Foundation Council (CFC)** can be asked to mediate the discussion.

The role of Maintainer, Project Lead or Organization Project Lead is granted or revoked through the decision-making
process,
with additional restrictions:

2. The opinion of the Maintainer, Project Lead or Organization Project Lead whose role is being discussed does not
